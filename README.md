# Past Game Development Projects (Spoilers Beware!):
## Solo Projects:
### Fate of the Pact
My first choose-your-own-adventure based on dungeons and dragons 5e, you meet the Raven Queen who offers you to have a chance to change the fate of Fable Quillore, a warlock under her contract. Shortly after, friends are calling your name concerned for your wellbeing and you have a job to do.
### Among Us IRL
Based on the game "Among Us". My first game packet, meant to play with friends, here is the post that goes with it. Link: [https://chickenstarrocketgames.itch.io/chickenstarrockets-among-us-irl-packet]
### June's Butterfly Scavenger Hunt
Made with Monogame C# but you can check out the details here: [insert link here]
### The Unfortunate Case Of Aria Grace
Sequel game to "Rise of the Owl: Cold Cases". 
### Rise of the Owl: Cold Cases
Used wordpress to "game-ify" a blog that no longer exists. 
### What's The Story?
My first solo project was made with GameMakerStudio2. You can play it here: [https://chickenstarrocketgames.itch.io/whats-the-story]
## Group Projects:
### Try Not to Shooter (GMTK 2018 submission)
The theme of the game jam was to make a game but do something different with one of the core mechanics of the genre. So my partner and I made a shooter game, but in order to progress, you can't kill anyone. Here is the link if you'd like to try it yourself: [https://cbdmgames.itch.io/try-not-to-shooter]
We had a rule where if we couldn't beat it, it couldn't be a level design. It was hard coming up with 12 levels. A lot of them have tricks you can do but it's been a few years since I've played this game. I promise I did beat that last level, it just took me an embarrassing amount of time.
Screenshot proof I beat the game-don't worry 11 doesn't turn green for some reason
### FIGHT ME! (Final Project for my 1st game dev class)
In a world where you can fight people for their jobs, this game inspired by Cuphead allows you to take four routes to become the president. Only one of the routes actually works. Here is the link if you'd like to play it for yourself: [https://gamejolt.com/games/httpsgamejoltcomCBDMgames/345866]. 
### Murder At West Ash ( Final Project for my second game dev class)
Inspired by Yandere Simulator, this game opens in the basement with a dead body in front of you. Clean up your crime, get rid of the evidence, and don't rouse the suspicion of the staff who work there and you just may get away with your crime. Fail, and there's a cell waiting for you. Unfortunately, it's not posted anywhere.
